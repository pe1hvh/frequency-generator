  10kHz to 225MHz VFO / RF Generator with Si5351 and Arduino Nano, with Intermediate Frequency (IF) offset
  (+ or -), RX/TX Selector for QRP Transceivers, Band Presets and Bargraph S-Meter. See the schematics for
  wiring and README.txt for details. By J. CesarSound - ver 2.0 - Feb/2021. 
  
  Forked by PE1HVH for a project done by the de VERON Afdeling 49/VRZA Afdeling 22.
  
  Changes   
  -------
   * refactored-code
   * given all variables meaningful names
   * standard lowerCamelCase nameconvention
   * standard indentation
   * standard formating
   * cleancode (so far as possible)
   * comment code 

  PlatformIO
  ----------
  While using PlatformIO with Visual Code as IDE, I have to re-order the function.
  
  PlatformIO requires that functions be declared before they are called in the code. This is because PlatformIO uses a more standard C++ compilation process,
  which adheres strictly to the requirement that functions must be declared before use.

  SonarLint
  ---------
  For writing cleancode, the Sonarlint plug-in is installed in Visual Code. 
  SonarLint is an open-source code analysis tool that serves several important functions to help developers write cleaner, safer, and higher-quality code. 
  There is no need, for using all sonarlint rules but the most important are enabled.
  
  Tested
  ------
  Build and Upload is tested also with Arduino IDE 2.3 and Arduino 1.8.19.
